The birds have less to say for themselves 
In the wood-world’s torn despair
Than now these numberless years the elves, 
Although they are no less there: 
All song of the woods is crushed like some 
Wild, easily shattered rose. 
Come, be my love in the wet woods; come,
Where the boughs rain when it blows.
