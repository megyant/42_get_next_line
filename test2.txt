When I consider how my light is spent,
Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,
And that one Talent which is death to hide
Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more bent
To serve therewith my Maker, and present
My true account, lest he returning chide;
“Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?”
I fondly ask. But patience, to prevent
The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift, 
The road is forlorn all day, 
Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift, 
And the hoof-prints vanish away. 
The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,
Expend their bloom in vain. 
Come over the hills and far with me, 
And be my love in the rain.
